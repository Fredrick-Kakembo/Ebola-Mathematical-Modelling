# Ebola-Mathematical-Modelling
Ebola is a highly infectious and deadly disease that has caused devastating outbreaks in several African countries in recent years. The disease is caused by the Ebola virus, which is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals. Mathematical modeling has played a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of Ebola outbreaks and in designing effective public health interventions.

One of the key concepts in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is the basic reproduction number, also known as R0. The basic reproduction number represents the expected number of secondary infections that one infected individual will produce in a completely susceptible population. In the case of Ebola, the basic reproduction number depends on several factors, such as the mode of transmission, the duration of infectiousness, and the effectiveness of control measures. 

Understanding the basic reproduction number is essential in predicting the spread of the disease and in evaluating the impact of different control strategies. In this assignment, we will develop a mathematical model of Ebola using the basic reproduction number and explore the implications of different control measures on the spread of the disease.
